* **Fast and Low-Power Quantized Fixed Posit High Accuracy DNN Implementation** (Jan 2021 - May 2021)
  * To overcome the drawback of standard IEEE-754 representation used to represent floating point numbers, we have analysed the effectiveness of using Posit number system by quantising the weights and biases of 8 different DNN in Posit and Fixed-posit formats.
  *  It is observed that accuracy remains within the range of 0.3%  and 0.57% of Top-1 accuracy for Posit and Fixed-posit representation. 
  *  Posit based multiplier requires higher PDP and area, whereas, Fixed-posit reduces PDP and area consumption by 71% and 36%, respectively.
